<br>

### How to run?
0. (Optional) Go to `settings` sheet in [BOM.xlsx](BOM.xlsx), modify the settings if needed.
1. Go to `BOM` sheet in [BOM.xlsx](BOM.xlsx), fill in master and new BOM info accordingly.
2. (For SAP_SOURCE = `manual` selected in step `#0` only): Place all relevant BOM and MCTO files in `BOM_590` folder and `MCTO` folder.
    - The provided files must be in `.csv` format exported from `SAP`.
    - For MCTO, the files must be named as `MCTO`_`PV` (eg: `705043_1.csv`)
3. Place all relevant bom recipes in `recipe-bom-master` folder.
4. Run [main.exe](main.exe).
5. Created new BOM recipes can be found in `recipe-bom-new` folder within subfolder grouped by `BOM_MCTO_PV`.
6. (Optional): View the BOM differences detail in `SCRIPT_OUTPUT.xlsx` by subfolder in `recipe-bom-new`.
7. (Optional): View the logs in [Log/BOM_PROGRAM_CREATE.log](Log/BOM_PROGRAM_CREATE.log).

### Limitations
Below are the limitations that cannot be handled. Warning will be raised as such the impacted line item will be skipped.
1. `Part Extra Place` or `Adding Part` cannot be handled.
2. `Part Sub` or `Subbing Part` with feeder used in any non-impacted designator cannot be handled.

### Test Cases
Below are the passing test cases, using [590-624661](BOM_590/590-624661.csv) as Master BOM.
